# Weather app

An application that provides the current weather and forecasts for the user's location and any searched city.

## Description

I built this application with vanilla javascript to cement my knowledge in the basics of web technologies (HTML, CSS & Javascript). The application acquires current weather and forecasts from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The project is deployed and live on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

- Get current weather and forecast of user's location.
- Search for current weather and forecast of any city.
- Save searched city to favorite. App will open favorite on next launch.

## Usage

- Just follow the link to the [weather app](https://kabaidoo-my-weather-app.netlify.app/) on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
